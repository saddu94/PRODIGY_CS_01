# PRODIGY_CS_01

This project was developed as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech, utilizing various self-study resources and references. The project focuses on creating a Python-based application to encrypt and decrypt plaintext using the Caesar cipher technique.

## Description

This Python application allows users to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext and decrypt ciphertext back into plaintext using the Caesar cipher method. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption:** The program can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher.
- **Key Range:** The application supports key values ranging from 1 to 26 for both encryption and decryption operations.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd PRODIGY_CS_01
   ```
3. **Run the Code:**
   ```sh
   python ./caesar_cipher.py
   ```

## Usage

- **Encryption:**
  - Enter the plaintext you wish to encrypt.
  - Choose a key value between 1 and 26.
  - The program will output the encrypted ciphertext.

- **Decryption:**
  - Enter the ciphertext you wish to decrypt.
  - Use the same key value that was used for encryption.
  - The program will output the decrypted plaintext.

## Notes

- The key must be an integer value between 1 and 26.
- Ensure the paths provided for saving and accessing files are correct.
